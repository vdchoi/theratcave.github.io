In the server, I'm responsible for our data and growth planning. To introduce myself, I’ll just share some of my interests:

In real life, I work as a senior data scientist managing product analytics and algorithm development. Always down to nerd out about data-related topics, or help out if you have any questions in your stats/math classes!

**Hobbies**  
I enjoy everything related to food and travel! I love to try new restaurants (or take-out now during COVID), cook new dishes, and watch travel/food documentaries. 

**Fun Fact**  
I was a classical piano instructor throughout college to fund my eating-out craze.
