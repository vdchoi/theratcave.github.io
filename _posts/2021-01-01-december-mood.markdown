#### The Rat Cave Playlist for December 2020

December was an incredibly eventful month for The Rat Cave. For all of you who were with us at the time, congrats on supassing 1,000 members! 
Filled with holidays, December gave us a final respite after one heck of a year. We are hopeful that the next year will bring even better news in every way.

Enjoy our playlist to remember the mood of December. Cheers!
